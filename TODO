     - [X] metaWeblog
     - [ ] the rest
   - [ ] RSD
   - [ ] Weblog creation using OpenWeblog.com
   - [ ] Menus
   - [ ] Toolbar
         Looks like this is partially implemented.
** Possible Features
*** *Buffer List* for blog entries
*** discover server
    Here's the idea:

    If you already have a weblog, and your weblog supports RSD
    (http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd), you can use
    
    M-x weblogger-discover-server RET url RET
    
    where url is the URL of your weblog.  This will set up your
    configuration for you if you let it.
** Implement GData
   - [X] post new entries
   - [X] edit old entries
   - [X] what's with the weird xhtml div thing?  That looks like
     plumbing.
   - [X] need to be able to delete entries
   - [X] need to move all the XML-RPC assumptions out of weblogger.el
   - [ ] edit template?
         Not supported by GData.
   - [X] save as draft, but don't publish
         - [X] can you go back to a draft after you've published it?
   - [X] move all the e-blog code out
   - [ ] what about the gblogger and g-client code?  
         Am I go to base it on top of gblogger? or just g-app?

         I see two choices, either I can rip the UI and stick it into
         gblogger and only support blogger.  Or, I can integrate it
         properly into weblogger, but then I have to find some way of
         testing it with all the xml-rpc junk.  

         I'm going to keep the xml-rpc because it works with
         livejournal.

   - [X] get the post url correctly
   - [X] get the right query url.
   - [ ] stick it into github
   - [ ] announce
   - [X] test it with an xmlrpc blog to make sure it still works
         I'm testing it with my livejournal account, and it does work.
   - [X] drafts aren't being pulled up.  fix it. 
   - [ ] fix the documentation
   - [ ] Need to fix all the my-* functions to become
     weblogger-gdata-* functions.
