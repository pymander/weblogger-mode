        - [X] can you go back to a draft after you've published it?
  - [X] move all the e-blog code out
  - [ ] what about the gblogger and g-client code?  
        Am I go to base it on top of gblogger? or just g-app?

        I see two choices, either I can rip the UI and stick it into
        gblogger and only support blogger.  Or, I can integrate it
        properly into weblogger, but then I have to find some way of
        testing it with all the xml-rpc junk.  

        I'm leaning towards just ripping out the UI from weblogger.
        Nope, I'm going to keep it all.
