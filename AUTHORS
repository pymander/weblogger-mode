   Original author of blogger.el it seems.

   Inspired the original author's implementation.

   This code was originally based on Simon Kittle's blogger.el
   (http://www.tswoam.co.uk/files/blogger.el.txt), but where his
   code calls a Perl program, this code uses xml-rpc.el.  You can
   get xml-rpc.el from <http://elisp.info/package/xml-rpc/>
   
   Differences between SK's blogger.el and weblogger.el
   
  - Doesn't need any external programs.  Uses xml-rpc.el.
  - I've added a bunch of defcustom's here to make this integrate
    better with Emacs Customization interface. 
  - Created a *weblogger-entry* mode.
  - Made selection of a weblog more intuitive.  It queries the
    server and allows the user to choose the name of the
    weblog from a list.
  - Prompt for weblog on initial entry if weblogger-id isn't set.
  - Can "ping" http://weblogs.com/ and http://blo.gs/ whenever
    you update.
  - Can "scroll" through entries on the weblog server and edit them.
  - Many other features.
