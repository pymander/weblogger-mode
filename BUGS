* BUGS
** Inherited bugs from 
   - When you delete an entry it gets deleted, but it doesn't
     disappear from your entry ring until you sync (M-g) with the
     server.  But this could be construed as a (mis)feature.
   - If the server isn't reachable, (weblogger-determine-capabilities)
     will get the wrong information.
   - Changed titles aren't put in the weblogger post ring.
** GData Bugs
   - [ ] reformats the xml in a pretty-print fashion.  Not really what
     I want.  Also, it only accepts xml with one root element.  A
     workaround is to place a div there, but that shouldn't be a
     user's concern.
